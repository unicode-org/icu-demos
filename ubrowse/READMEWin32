UNICODE BROWSER  :  by Steven R. Loomis, IBM
-------------------------

This file describes necessary steps for building and using unicode browser
on Win32 platforms.

Before reading this file, please read README file in the same directory.

BUILDING UNICODE BROWSER ON WIN32
---------------------------------

Required environment for building ubrowse on Win32 platforms is
the same as for building ICU - Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. 

Also, before building ubrowse, the whole icu system should be built and 
working.

ubrowse is automatically built by using using the provided ubrowse.dsw
work space in this directory, or by using all.dsw workspace in ..\all
directory. 

When you build ubrowse, you should get an executable file ubrowse.exe in
your debug or release directory, depending on the type of build.

RUNNING UNICODE BROWSER
-----------------------

Unicode browser is intendended to be run as a CGI-BIN application from
your web server. 

If you don't have the web server readily available, you can still start 
the ubrowse from command line. 

Setting up ubrowse to work with a web server involves several more steps.

1) Environment variable ICU_DATA should be set to point to icu data directory.
Although it is a requirement for running and building ICU, for some reason web
server do not transfer this environment variable. 

If you are using Apache for Win32 you should add the line:
SetEnv ICU_DATA c:\icu\source\data\ #or whatever is the path to your icu\source\data dir
to the end of httpd.conf file.

2) Copy file icudata.dll from icu data directory to any directory on PATH. 
(A good candidate is icu\source\data).

3) Copy ubrowse.exe to cgi-bin directory of your web server.

Try Unicode browser by going to http://localhost/cgi-bin/ubrowse
