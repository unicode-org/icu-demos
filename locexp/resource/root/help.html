<A NAME="display"><H2>Display Problems</H2></A>
The output of this dynamic page is dependent on your browser settings, installed fonts, and which encoding you choose.  If text displays incorrectly, you may need to change the encoding at the bottom of each Locale Explorer page.

<P>
<H3>Display Q&A</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Why do I see boxes or question-marks?</B></LI> 
     <UL>
       It may
     be that you do not have the proper font selected, or the font you
     have selected is missing some letters.  On Netscape, go into Edit
     -> Preferences and select the Fonts sub panel.  On Microsoft Internet
     Explorer, go into the Internet Options dialog and click on Fonts.
       <P>
       Also make sure the right <A HREF="#encoding">encoding</A> is selected.
     </UL><P>
     
  <LI><B>No text, "Garbage" text, <A NAME="encoding">Wrong Encoding</A></B>
      <UL>
        An Encoding is the specific method used to transfer letters to
      your browser.  Each encoding has a specific charset, or set of
      characters which it understands how to handle.  UTF-8 is the
      preferred encoding to use, as it can transfer directly any
      Unicode value (and therefore, any text which the Locale Explorer
      tries to show.)  However, if your browser does not understand
      UTF-8 or does not have the appropriate fonts, you may choose
      from among several other industry-standard encodings.  Be aware
      that some encodings will not be able to encode specific
      characters. If you try to view a Greek locale using the
      iso-8859-1 (Latin-1, Western European) encoding, you will simply
      see many \uXXXX letters <A HREF="#literals">(see below)</A>.   Check your browser
      settings to see which encodings it supports.
        <P>
	The Locale Explorer will attempt to negotiate an encoding with
      your browser, however you may force it to use a different
      encoding by clicking on the name of the current encoding in the
      'Your Settings' box, at the bottom of each Locale Explorer page.
      </UL><P>
  <LI><A NAME="literals"><B>I see '<U>\u1234</U>' instead of a letter.</B></A>
      <UL>
	 This is because the <A HREF="#encoding">encoding</A> you have
      chosen does not support the unicode character selected. Since
      the purpose of the Locale Explorer is educational, it displays
      the Unicode value instead of a questionmark. Note that the Sort,
      Numberformat, and Dateformat demos all accept the \uXXXX
      notation in their input fields.  ("\u" was chosen because this
      format is also used in ICU locale bundle files, and is a
      standard feature of Java as well.)
      </UL><P>
  <LI><B>Text is 'backwards', letters are drawn incorrectly. (Non-Latin scripts)</B>
     <UL>
       Drawing of some scripts, such as Arabic, depends heavily on the
       browser and OS having the correct fonts and drawing support.
       As well, scripts which are written right-to-left (such as
       Arabic or Hebrew) depend on the browser/OS to understand
       drawing text in this direction.  The Locale Explorer does not
       attempt to correct for these situations.
      </UL><P>
  <LI><B>How do I install fonts?</B>
    <UL>
      On the Macintosh, drag fonts into your System Folder icon and
      restart your browser. On Windows, bring up the Fonts control panel.
      On X Windows, use 'man mkfontdir' and 'man xset' for more
      information.
    </UL><P>
  <LI><B>Why do I see accents following characters, such as
      '<U>o"</U>', or accents following <U>\uXXXX</U> unicode
      characters?</B>
      <UL>
         The Locale Explorer uses a module called the Decomposition
      Callback when it cannot output a character in a specific
      encoding. It attempts a 'Unicode canonical character
      decomposition' to break accented and ligature characters apart,
      and then looks for possible substitutions for the decomposed
      forms.
      <P>
       As an example, set the Locale Explorer encoding to iso-8859-1
       and view Hungarian. 'Monday' in Hungarian ends with an '<U>o with
       double acute accent</U>'.  This is decomposed into '<U>o</U>' +
       '<U>double-acute</U>'.   O can be output as just a normal o.
       The double-acute is turned into a doublequote (<U>"</U>), which
       is then output. So the result is '<U>o"</U>' which is certainly
       more readable than an error character such as '<U>?</U>'.
      <P>
       For this reason, if your fonts are deficient, you may actually
       get better results (in some cases) by choosing iso-8859-1 or
       some other encoding, than utf-8.

   Symbols used in number formatting and parsing. Used in <A HREF="#NumberPatterns">NumberPatterns</A>.<P>
   <LI><B>Decimal Separator</B> - separates the integer and fractional part
   of the number.
   <LI><B>Grouping Separator</B> - groups (for example) units of thousands:  10^6 = 1,000,000. 


  The grouping separator is commonly used for thousands, but in some
  countries for ten-thousands. The interval is a constant number of
  digits between the grouping characters, such as 100,000,000 or 1,0000,0000.
  If you supply a pattern with multiple grouping characters, the interval
  between the last one and the end of the integer is the one that is
  used. So "#,##,###,####" == "######,####" == "##,####,####".

   <LI><B>Pattern Separator</B> - sets the character used for separating variant expressions. (For example:   <U>0.00<B>;</B>(0.00)</U>  where the second pattern is the form to use for negative number)
   <LI><B>Percent</B> - symbol used to indicate a percentage (1/100th) amount.  (If present, the value is also multiplied by 100 before formatting. That way 1.23 => 123%)

   <LI><B>ZeroDigit</B> - Symbol used to indicate a digit in the pattern, or zero if that place would otherwise be empty. For example, with the digit of '0',  the pattern "000" would format "34" as "034", but the pattern "0" would format "34" as just "34". As well, the digits 1-9 are expected to follow the code point of this specified 0 value.

   <LI><B>Digit</B> - Symbol used to indicate any digit value. If that digit is zero, then it is not shown.
   <LI><B>Minus Sign</B> - Symbol used to denote negative value.
   <LI><B>Exponential</B> - Symbol separating the mantissa and exponent values.
   <LI><B>PerMill</B> - symbol used to indicate a per-mille (1/1000th) amount.  (If present, the value is also multiplied by 1000 before formatting. That way 1.23 => 1230 [1/000])
   <LI><B>Infinity</B> - The infinity sign. Corresponds to the IEEE infinity bit pattern.
   <LI><B>Not a number</B> - The NaN sign. Corresponds to the IEEE NaN bit pattern.
  </UL>

<HR><A NAME="NumberPatterns"><H2>Number Patterns</H2></A><UL>  
Patterns for formatting different types of numbers. 
Note that the <A HREF="#NumberElements">NumberElements</A> resource
affects how these patterns are interpreted.


<LI><B>Decimal</B>
<LI><B>Currency</B>
 Use \u00A4 where the local currency symbol should be.  Doubling the 
 currency symbol (\u00A4\u00A4) will output the international currency
 symbol (a 3-letter code).
<LI><B>Percent</B>  Pattern for use with percentage formatting
<LI><B>Scientific</B> Pattern for use with scientific (exponent) formatting.

<HR><A NAME="EXPLORE_CollationElements"><H2>Collation (sorting) Example</H2></A><UL> 

This example demonstrates sorting 
      (collation) in this locale. Type in some 
      lines of text to be sorted, and click the <STRONG>Sort</STRONG> button. 
      (The notes below explain what happens).


You see four different columns as output. The first 
is the original text for comparison. The lines are numbered to show their 
original position. The&nbsp;remaining columns show sorting by different 
strengths (available as a parameter to the collation function).&nbsp;Groups of 
lines that sort&nbsp;precisely the same are separated by an&nbsp;underline. 
Since collation treats these lines as identical, lines in the same group could 
appear in any order (depending on the precise sorting algorithm used).
<P>The demo shows three different strengths used when 
comparing any two strings:
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2><EM>Primary Only</EM>&nbsp;means that only major 
  differences are considered, such as different base letters (e.g. <EM>A vs 
  B</EM>).</FONT></LI>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2><EM>Primary &amp; Secondary</EM> means that a 
  second level of differences is also considered, such as accents 
  (e.g.&nbsp;<EM>A vs Á</EM>). However, these are only relevant if there are 
  <EM>no</EM> primary differences anywhere else in the strings.</FONT></LI><FONT 
  face=Arial size=2>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2><EM>Primary - Tertiary </EM>means that a third 
  level of differences is also considered, such as case (e.g. <EM>A vs a</EM>). 
  However, these are only relevant if there are <EM>no</EM> primary differences 
  and no secondary differences anywhere else in the 
strings.</FONT></LI></FONT></UL>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><EM>Primary - Tertiary</EM> is the only collation 
people will normally use; however, these levels are also used in searching, for 
a "loose" match. In some languages, such as French, secondary differences are 
counted from the <EM>end</EM> of the strings. You see this if you look at the 
difference in sorting between English and French for 
the&nbsp;lines:&nbsp;"côté", "coté", "côte", and "cote".</FONT></DIV>

  In this example you can try creating localized patterns and
  formatting dates using those patterns. <P>

  The top form shows the pattern you are working with. It is the same
  kind of pattern as the pre-set patterns found in the <A
  HREF="#DateTimePatterns">DateTimePatterns</A> resource.  The
  characters used in the pattern are the <A
  HREF="#localPatternChars">localized pattern characters</A> for that
  locale. They are reprinted at the bottom of the demo for your
  convenience.

<P>
  Below the pattern is the current date/time (at left), and the
  formatted version using your pattern (at right).
