    <h2><a name="display">Display Problems</a></h2>

    <p>The output of this dynamic page is dependent on your browser settings,
    installed fonts, and which encoding you choose. If text displays
    incorrectly, you may need to change the encoding at the bottom of each
    Locale Explorer page.</p>

    <h3>Display Q&amp;A</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Why do I see boxes or question-marks?</b> 

        <blockquote>
          It may be that you do not have the proper font selected, or the font
          you have selected is missing some letters. On Netscape, go into Edit
          -&gt; Preferences and select the Fonts sub panel. On Microsoft
          Internet Explorer, go into the Internet Options dialog and click on
          Fonts. 

          <p>Also make sure the right <a href="#encoding">encoding</a> is
          selected.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>No text, "Garbage" text, <a name="encoding">Wrong Encoding</a></b> 

        <blockquote>
          An Encoding is the specific method used to transfer letters to your
          browser. Each encoding has a specific charset, or set of characters
          which it understands how to handle. UTF-8 is the preferred encoding
          to use, as it can transfer directly any Unicode value (and therefore,
          any text which the Locale Explorer tries to show.) However, if your
          browser does not understand UTF-8 or does not have the appropriate
          fonts, you may choose from among several other industry-standard
          encodings. Be aware that some encodings will not be able to encode
          specific characters. If you try to view a Greek locale using the
          iso-8859-1 (Latin-1, Western European) encoding, you will simply see
          many \uXXXX letters <a href="#literals">(see below)</a>. Check your
          browser settings to see which encodings it supports. 

          <p>The Locale Explorer will attempt to negotiate an encoding with
          your browser, however you may force it to use a different encoding by
          clicking on the name of the current encoding in the 'Your Settings'
          box, at the bottom of each Locale Explorer page.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
        <a name="literals"><b>I see '<u>\u1234</u>' instead of a
        letter.</b></a> 

        <blockquote>
          This is because the <a href="#encoding">encoding</a> you have chosen
          does not support the unicode character selected. Since the purpose of
          the Locale Explorer is educational, it displays the Unicode value
          instead of a questionmark. Note that the Sort, Numberformat, and
          Dateformat demos all accept the \uXXXX notation in their input
          fields. ("\u" was chosen because this format is also used in ICU
          locale bundle files, and is a standard feature of Java as well.)
        </blockquote>

      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Text is 'backwards', letters are drawn incorrectly. (Non-Latin
        scripts)</b> 

        <blockquote>
          Drawing of some scripts, such as Arabic, depends heavily on the
          browser and OS having the correct fonts and drawing support. As well,
          scripts which are written right-to-left (such as Arabic or Hebrew)
          depend on the browser/OS to understand drawing text in this
          direction. The Locale Explorer does not attempt to correct for these
          situations.
        </blockquote>

      </li>

      <li>
        <b>How do I install fonts?</b> 

        <blockquote>
          On the Macintosh, drag fonts into your System Folder icon and restart
          your browser. On Windows, bring up the Fonts control panel. On X
          Windows, use 'man mkfontdir' and 'man xset' for more information.
        </blockquote>

      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Why do I see accents following characters, such as '<u>o"</u>', or
        accents following <u>\uXXXX</u> unicode characters?</b> 

        <blockquote>
          The Locale Explorer uses a module called the Decomposition Callback
          when it cannot output a character in a specific encoding. It attempts
          a 'Unicode canonical character decomposition' to break accented and
          ligature characters apart, and then looks for possible substitutions
          for the decomposed forms. 

          <p>As an example, set the Locale Explorer encoding to iso-8859-1 and
          view Hungarian. 'Monday' in Hungarian ends with an '<u>o with double
          acute accent</u>'. This is decomposed into '<u>o</u>' +
          '<u>double-acute</u>'. O can be output as just a normal o. The
          double-acute is turned into a doublequote (<u>"</u>), which is then
          output. So the result is '<u>o"</u>' which is certainly more readable
          than an error character such as '<u>?</u>'.</p>

          <p>For this reason, if your fonts are deficient, you may actually get
          better results (in some cases) by choosing iso-8859-1 or some other
          encoding, than utf-8.</p>

      <dt><b>Decimal Separator</b></dt>

      <dd>- separates the integer and fractional part of the number.</dd>

      <dt><b>Grouping Separator</b></dt>

      <dd>- groups (for example) units of thousands: 10^6 = 1,000,000. The
      grouping separator is commonly used for thousands, but in some countries
      for ten-thousands. The interval is a constant number of digits between
      the grouping characters, such as 100,000,000 or 1,0000,0000. If you
      supply a pattern with multiple grouping characters, the interval between
      the last one and the end of the integer is the one that is used. So
      "#,##,###,####" == "######,####" == "##,####,####".</dd>

      <dt><b>Pattern Separator</b></dt>

      <dd>- sets the character used for separating variant expressions. (For
      example: <u>0.00<b>;</b>(0.00)</u> where the second pattern is the form
      to use for negative number)</dd>

      <dt><b>Percent</b></dt>

      <dd>- symbol used to indicate a percentage (1/100th) amount. (If present,
      the value is also multiplied by 100 before formatting. That way 1.23
      =&gt; 123%)</dd>

      <dt><b>ZeroDigit</b></dt>

      <dd>- Symbol used to indicate a digit in the pattern, or zero if that
      place would otherwise be empty. For example, with the digit of '0', the
      pattern "000" would format "34" as "034", but the pattern "0" would
      format "34" as just "34". As well, the digits 1-9 are expected to follow
      the code point of this specified 0 value.</dd>

      <dt><b>Digit</b></dt>

      <dd>- Symbol used to indicate any digit value. If that digit is zero,
      then it is not shown.</dd>

      <dt><b>Minus Sign</b></dt>

      <dd>- Symbol used to denote negative value.</dd>

      <dt><b>Exponential</b></dt>

      <dd>- Symbol separating the mantissa and exponent values.</dd>

      <dt><b>PerMill</b></dt>

      <dd>- symbol used to indicate a per-mille (1/1000th) amount. (If present,
      the value is also multiplied by 1000 before formatting. That way 1.23
      =&gt; 1230 [1/000])</dd>

      <dt><b>Infinity</b></dt>

      <dd>- The infinity sign. Corresponds to the IEEE infinity bit
      pattern.</dd>

      <dd>The normal locale specific way to write a base 10 number.</dd>

      <dt><b>Currency</b></dt>

      <dd>Use \u00A4 where the local currency symbol should be. Doubling the
      currency symbol (\u00A4\u00A4) will output the international currency
      symbol (a 3-letter code).</dd>

    <p>Characters may be used multiple times. For example, if y is used for the
    year, 'yy' might produce '99', whereas 'yyyy' produces '1999'.</p>

    <p>For most numerical characters, the number of characters specifies the
    field width. For example, if h is the hour, 'h' might produce '5', but 'hh'
    produces '05'. For some characters, the count specifies whether an
    abbreviated or full form should be used.</p>

         Week 1 for a year is the first week that contains at least getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()

    <p>This example demonstrates sorting (collation) in this locale. Type in
    some lines of text to be sorted, and click the <strong>Sort</strong>
    button. (The notes below explain what happens). You see four different
    columns as output. The first is the original text for comparison. The lines
    are numbered to show their original position. The remaining columns show
    sorting by different strengths (available as a parameter to the collation
    function). Groups of lines that sort precisely the same are separated by an
    underline. Since collation treats these lines as identical, lines in the
    same group could appear in any order (depending on the precise sorting
    algorithm used).</p>

    <p>The demo shows three different strengths used when comparing any two
    strings:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Primary Only</em> means that only major differences are
      considered, such as different base letters (e.g. <em>A vs B</em>).</li>

      <li><em>Primary &amp; Secondary</em> means that a second level of
      differences is also considered, such as accents (e.g. <em>A vs
      &Aacute;</em>). However, these are only relevant if there are <em>no</em>
      primary differences anywhere else in the strings.</li>

      <li><em>Primary - Tertiary</em> means that a third level of differences
      is also considered, such as case (e.g. <em>A vs a</em>). However, these
      are only relevant if there are <em>no</em> primary differences and no
      secondary differences anywhere else in the strings.</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
      <em>Primary - Tertiary</em> is the only collation people will normally
      use; however, these levels are also used in searching, for a "loose"
      match. In some languages, such as French, secondary differences are
      counted from the <em>end</em> of the strings. You see this if you look at
      the difference in sorting between English and French for the lines:
      "c&ocirc;t&eacute;", "cot&eacute;", "c&ocirc;te", and "cote".

     This example demonstrates how the ICU can sort text in a
     locale-specific way.  Type some lines of text into the box provided,
     and click sort. The text will be sorted according to the collation
     rules of the specified locale. All four different strengths will be
     tried, and the results are shown side by side.

    <h2><a name="EXPLORE_NumberPatterns">Number Pattern Demo</a></h2>

    <p>In this example you can try creating localized patterns and formatting
    numbers using those patterns.</p>

    <p>The top form shows the pattern you are working with. It is the same kind
    of pattern as the pre-set patterns found in the <a href=
    "#NumberPatterns">NumberPatterns</a> resource. Also, see the <a href=
    "#NumberElements">NumberElements</a> resource for important information on
    the characters used in each pattern.</p>

    <p>The left hand side shows the number that will be formatted. You may
    change this number (and click Change) to see it's effect on the formatted
    number.</p>

    <p>The right hand side shows the formatted number. You may also change the
    formatted version of the number (and click Change) to see it converted back
    onto the left hand side.</p>

    <p>Note that you may type in unicode values directly. For example, typing
    '\u0416' will be replaced with the Cyrillic letter "Zhe", which is at
    Unicode code point U+0416.</p>

    <h2><a name="EXPLORE_DateTimePatterns">Date &amp; Time Pattern
    Demo</a></h2>

    <p>In this example you can try creating localized patterns and formatting
    dates using those patterns.</p>

    <p>The top form shows the pattern you are working with. It is the same kind
    of pattern as the pre-set patterns found in the <a href=
    "#DateTimePatterns">DateTimePatterns</a> resource. The characters used in
    the pattern are the <a href="#localPatternChars">localized pattern
    characters</a> for that locale. They are reprinted at the bottom of the
    demo for your convenience.</p>

    <p>Below the pattern is the current date/time (at left), and the formatted
    version using your pattern (at right).</p>

    <p>Note that you may type in unicode values directly. For example, typing
    '\u0416' will be replaced with the Cyrillic letter "Zhe", which is at
    Unicode code point U+0416.</p>
